Version 0.2
-----------

- update sample run script, remove empty addresses from mempool

Version 0.1
------------

- added setup.py, experimental.  Because of this server_main.py renamed
  electrumx_server.py, and SERVER_MAIN environment variable was renamed
  to ELECTRUMX.  The sample run script was updated to match.
- improvements to logging of daemon connection issues
- removal of old reorg test code
- hopefully more accurate sync ETA

Version 0.07
------------

- fixed a bug introduced in 0.06 at the last minute

Version 0.06
------------

- mempool support.  ElectrumX maintains a representation of the daemon's
  mempool and serves unconfirmed transactions and balances to clients.

Version 0.05
------------

- fixed a bug in 0.04 that stopped ElectrumX serving once synced

Version 0.04
------------

- made the DB interface a little faster for LevelDB and RocksDB; this was
  a small regression in 0.03
- fixed a bug that prevented block reorgs from working
- implement and enable client connectivity.  This is not yet ready for
  public use for several reasons.  Local RPC, and remote TCP and SSL
  connections are all supported in the same way as Electrum-server.
  ElectrumX does not begin listening for incoming connections until it
  has caught up with the daemon's height.  Which ports it is listening
  on will appear in the logs when it starts listening.  The complete
  Electrum wire protocol is implemented, so it is possible to now use
  as a server for your own Electrum client.  Note that mempools are
  not yet handled so unconfirmed transactions will not be notified or
  appear; they will appear once they get in a block.  Also no
  responses are cached, so performance would likely degrade if used by
  many clients.  I welcome feedback on your experience using this.


Version 0.03
------------

- merged bauerj's abstracted DB engine contribution to make it easy to
  play with different backends.  In addition to LevelDB this adds
  support for RocksDB and LMDB.  We're interested in your comparitive
  performance experiences.


Version 0.02
------------

- fix bug where tx counts were incorrectly saved
- large clean-up and refactoring of code, breakout into new files
- several efficiency improvements
- initial implementation of chain reorg handling
- work on RPC and TCP server functionality.  Code committed but not
  functional, so currently disabled
- note that some of the enivronment variables have been renamed,
