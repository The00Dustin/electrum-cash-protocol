Fulcrum Protocol
================

The `Fulcrum <https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum>`_ protocol is basically the same as 
`ElectrumX <https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx>`_ and other Electrum-based protocol 
servers such `ElectrsCash <https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/ElectrsCash>`_. 
This protocol was initially designed for Bitcoin BTC but has since been adopted by Bitcoin Cash 
for use with `Electron Cash <https://electroncash.org>`_, and continues to evolve 
independently of BTC. The Bitcoin Cash variant of the protocol is known as 
the Electrum Cash Protocol.

This documentation is intended to be a reference for client and server authors
alike.
